C, a versatile language, isn’t confined to any domain. It’s rich in operators and has modern control flow. Not a ‘high level’ or ‘large’ language, its broad applicability makes it practical. Originated in UNIX on DEC PDP-11, it was designed by D. Ritchie. The C compiler, UNIX OS, and all UNIX apps are written in C.
